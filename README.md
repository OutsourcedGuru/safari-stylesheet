# safari-stylesheet
A custom stylesheet for the Safari browser to block unwanted Outlook ads in your browser, for example

## Overview
I use the online Outlook website to read some of my email since I no longer pay Microsoft for an Office 365 subscription. As a result of this I found myself being too-often disrupted by the annoying/fidgety ads seen on the right. Had the ads been stationary I might not have minded so much. At some point with these animated ads one has to fight back, this is simply too much to endure.

So I created this custom stylesheet for Safari, for example. It may work for other browsers as well but I'm documenting it for this one.

## Installation

```
cd ~/sites
git clone https://github.com/OutsourcedGuru/safari-stylesheet.git
```

Next, go into `Safari -> Preferences -> Advanced` and set `Style Sheet` to the `style.css` in this new folder.
